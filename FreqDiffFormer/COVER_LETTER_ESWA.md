Dear Editor,

Please find attached our manuscript entitled "FreqDiffFormer: Frequency-Guided Transformer–Diffusion Framework for Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval" for consideration in *Expert Systems With Applications*.

We believe the manuscript is well suited for ESWA because it presents a novel hybrid architecture combining frequency-domain encoding, transformer-based alignment, and diffusion-guided latent refinement, validated on four FG-SBIR benchmarks with statistically significant improvements.

Key points:
- Novel hybrid architecture (Frequency + Transformer + Diffusion)
- Comprehensive experiments on Sketchy, ShoeV2, ChairV2, TU-Berlin
- Statistically significant gains (Wilcoxon p < 0.01)
- Near real-time inference reported on RTX A6000 (9.4 ms / image)
- Code and reproduction materials are provided in the attached repository.

Suggested reviewers:

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Mohammed Al-Mohamadi
